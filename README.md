- **TypeScript**: Benefit from static type checking with TypeScript in development.
- **Vite**: Experience blazing-fast builds and updates with Vite's HMR.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Style your app with utility-first CSS for rapid UI development.
- **Appwrite Integration**: Secure and scalable backend services with Appwrite for authentication, database, storage, and more.
- **React Query**: Efficient server state management in React applications.
- **Responsive Design**: Built-in responsive design with Tailwind CSS for a great mobile and desktop experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with BuildShare, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/freddykhant/buildshare_app.git
cd buildshare
```

## Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## Set up environment variables

Copy the .env.local.example file to .env.local and update the variables to match your Appwrite project settings.

## Run the development server

<b>npm run dev</b>: Scripts

```sh
npm run dev:
```

Start the development server with hot module replacement.

```sh
npm run build:
```

Build the application for production.

```sh
npm run lint:
```

Lint the project files.

```sh
npm run preview:
```

Preview the production build.

### Expanding ESLint Configuration

For production applications, consider enhancing the ESLint configuration for type-aware linting. Update the .eslintrc.cjs file as follows:

Use

```sh
plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked
```

for stricter type checks.

Add

```shplugin:react/recommended and plugin:react-hooks/recommended

```

for React specific linting.
